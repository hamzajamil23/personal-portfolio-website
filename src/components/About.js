              Hi, my name is Hamza Jamil. I'm a mechanical engineering graduate who transitioned into data science out of a passion for analytics and problem solving. My journey began in 2022 when I realized how data could uncover insights that drive real decisions‚Äîand that clicked with me instantly.
          </p>
          
          <p ref={el => textRefs.current[1] = el}>
             Since then, I have earned a Data Science and AI certificate from the Boston Institute of Analytics and built a strong foundation in <span className="highlight">SQL, Tableau, and Python</span>.   For me, data analysis feels like playing detective‚Äîpiecing together clues from numbers to reveal the bigger picture.
          </p>
          
          <p ref={el => textRefs.current[2] = el}>
            After completing my BS in Mechanical Engineering from UMT, I began my professional journey as an intern at Dominar Engineers, a channel partner of KSB Pumps. Within two months, I was hired as a Sales Engineer and successfully closed over 25 million PKR in industrial pump sales across Punjab and northern Pakistan. While working full-time, I nurtured a growing interest in analytics and automation. In early 2024, I formally enrolled in a Data Science and AI certification program at the Boston Institute of Analytics, where I developed hands-on skills in Python, machine learning, and building real-world applications. This marked the turning point where I fully committed to transitioning into the data science field.
          </p>
          
          <p ref={el => textRefs.current[3] = el}>
          Outside of work, I‚Äôm passionate about brewing great coffee, baking, and watching movies. I also enjoy exploring new technologies, staying curious, and continuously learning. This often involves coding, building personal projects, or diving into a rabbit hole after reading something that sparks a newfound interest.
